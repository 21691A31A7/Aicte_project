Secure Data Hiding in Images using Steganography
📌 Project Overview
This project provides a secure and user-friendly way to encrypt and decrypt messages within images using steganography and password protection. The message is embedded inside an image using OpenCV and can only be retrieved with the correct password.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python – Programming language
OpenCV – Image processing
NumPy – Array manipulation
PyQt6 – Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 Features
✔ Steganography-based encryption – Hides messages within image pixels.
✔ Password-protected decryption – Ensures secure message retrieval.
✔ Graphical User Interface (GUI) – Easy-to-use interface.
✔ No need for external storage – The message is stored directly in the image.
✔ Works with PNG images – Saves encrypted images in lossless format.
